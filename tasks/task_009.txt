# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Error Handling and User Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the existing basic feedback system with comprehensive error handling and detailed user notifications.
# Details:
The basic feedback for successful synchronization is already implemented. Now we need to enhance the system with: 1) A robust error handling system that catches and processes errors at various levels (configuration, connection, data fetching, transformation, and synchronization). 2) User-friendly error messages that provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues. 3) Improved toast notifications for progress and error states. 4) Detailed logging for troubleshooting. 5) Recovery mechanisms where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling by simulating various failure scenarios. Verify user-friendly messages are displayed. Confirm enhanced toast notifications work correctly for different states. Test recovery mechanisms to ensure they work as expected. Verify that the existing successful synchronization feedback continues to work properly.
