# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Supabase Connection Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Supabase connection module to handle authentication and connection to Supabase projects.
# Details:
Implement src/supabase.ts to handle Supabase client initialization with dynamic URL and API key. Create functions for testing connection, fetching available tables, and validating credentials. Implement secure storage of credentials within the Framer plugin environment. Add error handling for connection failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test connection with valid and invalid credentials. Verify that tables can be fetched from a test Supabase project. Ensure credentials are securely stored and can be retrieved between sessions.
