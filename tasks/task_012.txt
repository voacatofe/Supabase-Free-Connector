# Task ID: 12
# Title: Add Error Handling and Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the plugin with user-friendly error messages and recovery options.
# Details:
Create a centralized error handling system. Implement specific error handling for connection issues, permission problems, and data synchronization failures. Add retry mechanisms for transient errors. Create user-friendly error messages and suggestions for resolution. Implement logging for debugging purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios by simulating various failure conditions (network issues, invalid credentials, schema changes). Verify that errors are properly caught, displayed to the user, and that recovery options work as expected.
