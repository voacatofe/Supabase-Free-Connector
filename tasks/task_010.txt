# Task ID: 10
# Title: Finalize Plugin Modes and Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Complete the implementation of required Framer plugin modes and ensure seamless integration. The plugin is already working in development mode, but final optimizations and refinements are still needed.
# Details:
The plugin is currently functional in development mode, but requires finalization and optimization. Complete the implementation of both required plugin modes: syncManagedCollection and configureManagedCollection. Ensure proper integration with Framer's plugin system. Implement configuration persistence between sessions. Add plugin metadata and documentation. Perform final optimization for performance. Ensure the plugin adheres to Framer's size limitations for plugin data storage (2kB per entry, 4kB total).

# Test Strategy:
Test both plugin modes in the Framer environment. Verify configuration persistence across sessions. Confirm the plugin works correctly with the Framer CMS. Test with various project sizes to ensure performance and storage limitations are respected.
