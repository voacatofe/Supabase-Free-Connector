# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Supabase Authentication Storage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create secure storage mechanism for Supabase URL and Anon Key using localStorage.
# Details:
Implement utility functions to securely store and retrieve Supabase credentials (URL and Anon Key) in localStorage. Include validation to ensure credentials are properly formatted. Create functions for setting, getting, and clearing credentials. Add encryption if possible for additional security. Ensure credentials are never exposed in logs or error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Test storing and retrieving credentials. Verify validation rejects malformed URLs or keys. Confirm credentials persist across page reloads but can be cleared when needed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic credential storage utility functions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement core utility functions for storing, retrieving, and clearing Supabase credentials in localStorage with proper validation
### Details:
1. Create a new utility file (e.g., `supabaseStorage.js`)
2. Implement constants for localStorage keys (e.g., `SUPABASE_URL_KEY`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
3. Create validation functions to check URL format (should be a valid URL) and Anon Key format (should be a non-empty string)
4. Implement `storeSupabaseCredentials(url, anonKey)` function that validates inputs before storing in localStorage
5. Implement `getSupabaseCredentials()` function that retrieves and returns both values as an object
6. Implement `clearSupabaseCredentials()` function to remove stored values
7. Add error handling that doesn't expose credential values in error messages
8. Write unit tests for validation logic and storage operations

## 2. Add encryption layer for credential storage [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Enhance security by implementing encryption/decryption for stored credentials
### Details:
1. Research and select a lightweight encryption library suitable for browser environments (e.g., CryptoJS)
2. Install the selected encryption library
3. Create encryption utility functions in a separate file (e.g., `encryption.js`)
4. Implement `encrypt(data, secretKey)` function that returns encrypted string
5. Implement `decrypt(encryptedData, secretKey)` function that returns decrypted data
6. Generate a device-specific encryption key (could be derived from browser fingerprint or randomly generated and stored)
7. Modify the credential storage functions from subtask 1 to use encryption/decryption
8. Update unit tests to verify encryption is working correctly
9. Test in different browsers to ensure compatibility

## 3. Create secure credential management interface [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Build a higher-level interface for securely managing Supabase credentials with additional security measures
### Details:
1. Create a new file (e.g., `supabaseAuth.js`) that will serve as the main interface for credential management
2. Implement a `SupabaseCredentialManager` class that internally uses the storage and encryption utilities
3. Add methods for initializing credentials, checking if credentials exist, and validating credentials
4. Implement credential rotation capability (ability to update credentials)
5. Add an optional timeout feature that automatically clears credentials after a period of inactivity
6. Implement a method to create a Supabase client instance using stored credentials
7. Add logging that records credential operations without exposing sensitive data
8. Create comprehensive documentation with usage examples
9. Write integration tests that verify the complete credential management flow
10. Implement a demo page showing how to use the credential manager
