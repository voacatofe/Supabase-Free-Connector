# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the core UI components for the plugin interface following Framer's design patterns.
# Details:
Implement the main app.tsx component with a modern, responsive layout using Tailwind CSS. Create basic UI components for the configuration screens including form inputs, buttons, and status indicators. Support both light and dark themes to match Framer's interface. Implement basic navigation between different sections of the plugin.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test UI components in Framer Desktop. Verify responsive behavior and theme compatibility. Ensure all interactive elements provide appropriate feedback.
