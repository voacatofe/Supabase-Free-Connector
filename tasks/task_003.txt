# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create TypeScript Type Definitions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define TypeScript types for both Framer and Supabase data structures to ensure type safety throughout the application.
# Details:
Create types/framer.ts and types/supabase.ts files. Define interfaces for Supabase tables, fields, and connection settings. Create type mappings between Supabase data types and Framer CMS types according to the mapping table in the PRD. Include types for configuration storage and plugin state management.

# Test Strategy:
Validate type definitions by using them in sample code. Ensure all required types are covered and properly exported.
