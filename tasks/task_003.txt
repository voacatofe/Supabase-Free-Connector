# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Supabase Client Initialization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a module to initialize and manage the Supabase client using stored credentials.
# Details:
Implement a Supabase client factory that initializes the client using credentials from localStorage. Include error handling for missing or invalid credentials. Create a mechanism to test connection validity. Implement proper client disposal when needed. Ensure the client is initialized with appropriate timeout and retry settings.

# Test Strategy:
Test client initialization with valid and invalid credentials. Verify connection testing works correctly. Confirm error handling properly captures and reports authentication issues.
