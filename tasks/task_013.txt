# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Synchronization Monitoring UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 11, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a UI component to monitor and control the synchronization process.
# Details:
Develop a monitoring interface showing sync status, last sync time, and any errors. Add controls to manually trigger synchronization. Implement a log viewer for sync events. Create visual indicators for real-time sync status. Add options to configure sync behavior (frequency, automatic vs. manual).

# Test Strategy:
Test the monitoring UI with various sync scenarios. Verify that status indicators accurately reflect the current state. Confirm that manual sync controls work correctly.
