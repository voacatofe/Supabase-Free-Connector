# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Field Mapping Utility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create utility functions to map between Supabase and Framer data types and field structures.
# Details:
Implement utils/fieldMapper.ts to handle automatic detection and mapping of Supabase field types to Framer CMS types. Support all types mentioned in the PRD: text to String, int4 to Number, bool to Boolean, timestamp to Date, jsonb to Object, and text[] to Array. Include functions to preview how data will appear after mapping.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various field types from Supabase and verify correct mapping to Framer types. Create test cases for each supported data type and edge cases.
