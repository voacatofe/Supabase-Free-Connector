# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Supabase Configuration UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the UI for Supabase connection configuration with credential input and connection testing.
# Details:
Develop a form interface for entering Supabase project URL and anon key. Add validation for input fields with appropriate error messages. Implement a 'Test Connection' button that provides visual feedback on connection status. Create a secure storage mechanism for saving valid credentials. Add UI for clearing saved credentials if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test the form with valid and invalid inputs. Verify connection testing works correctly. Confirm credentials are saved and can be retrieved when the plugin is reopened.
