# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Data Transformation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create utilities to transform Supabase data to Framer CMS format based on field mappings.
# Details:
Develop transformation functions that convert Supabase data types to Framer CMS compatible formats according to the user-defined mappings. Handle special cases like dates, JSON objects, and arrays. Implement type checking and validation to ensure data integrity. Create fallback mechanisms for handling null or undefined values. Support all Framer field types mentioned in the requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test transformation with various data types and edge cases. Verify correct handling of null/undefined values. Test with large datasets to ensure performance. Confirm all Framer field types are properly supported.
