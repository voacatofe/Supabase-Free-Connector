      "complexityScore": 7,

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data transformation logic implementation into specific subtasks covering: 1) Core type conversion functions, 2) Special data type handlers (dates, JSON, arrays), 3) Validation and type checking system, 4) Null/undefined value handling, and 5) Integration with the tooltip system. For each subtask, specify inputs, outputs, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex data type transformations with validation requirements. The need to handle multiple special cases (dates, JSON, arrays) and implement fallback mechanisms increases complexity. Integration with an existing tooltip system adds another layer of complexity. The task is well-defined but requires careful implementation to ensure data integrity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Upsert Synchronization Logic",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the upsert synchronization logic implementation into specific subtasks covering: 1) Differential data comparison algorithm, 2) Primary key-based item matching, 3) Update vs. create decision logic, 4) Batching mechanism for large datasets, 5) Progress tracking implementation, and 6) Deletion handling. For each subtask, specify the technical approach, edge cases to handle, and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on existing functionality but requires implementing complex differential synchronization logic. The need to handle large datasets with batching, track progress, and implement proper error handling makes this highly complex. The high priority indicates its critical nature to the project's success. The upsert logic requires careful design to ensure data consistency."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling and user feedback implementation into specific subtasks covering: 1) Multi-level error catching system, 2) Error categorization and message generation, 3) Toast notification enhancements, 4) Logging system implementation, and 5) Recovery mechanism design. For each subtask, specify the user experience goals and technical implementation details.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves enhancing an existing basic system with more comprehensive error handling. While not as technically complex as data transformation or synchronization, it requires careful consideration of user experience and error scenarios. The task spans multiple components (UI notifications, error handling, logging) but has clear requirements."

      "taskTitle": "Finalize Plugin Modes and Integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the plugin finalization work into specific subtasks covering: 1) Implementation of syncManagedCollection mode, 2) Implementation of configureManagedCollection mode, 3) Configuration persistence mechanism, and 4) Performance optimization and size limitation compliance. For each subtask, specify the acceptance criteria and integration points with Framer's plugin system.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on finalizing and optimizing existing functionality rather than implementing new complex features. The main challenges are ensuring proper integration with Framer's plugin system and adhering to size limitations. The low priority suggests this is more about polishing than critical functionality. The task is well-defined with clear requirements."
