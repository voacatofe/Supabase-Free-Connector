      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the key steps required to initialize a new TypeScript project for a Framer plugin, including setting up tsconfig.json, installing dependencies, and organizing the folder structure according to best practices.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup steps, including TypeScript configuration, dependency installation, and folder structuring. While not algorithmically complex, it requires attention to detail and adherence to Framer and TypeScript best practices to ensure maintainability and scalability[6][9]."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Supabase Authentication Storage",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of implementing secure storage for Supabase credentials in localStorage, including validation, encryption, and safe access patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Securely handling credentials adds complexity due to the need for validation, optional encryption, and ensuring credentials are never exposed. This requires careful design to avoid security pitfalls and ensure robust error handling[4][8]."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Supabase Client Initialization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Describe the steps to create a Supabase client factory that initializes using stored credentials, handles errors, tests connection validity, and manages client lifecycle.",
      "reasoning": "Client initialization must handle dynamic credentials, error states, and resource management. Adding connection testing and disposal increases the need for robust, modular code and clear error reporting[2][4]."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Table Selection Interface",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the process for building a UI component that fetches tables from Supabase, displays them, allows selection, and shows schema details, including loading and error states.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines asynchronous data fetching, dynamic UI updates, and error handling. Integrating with Framer's UI components and ensuring a smooth user experience adds to the complexity[3][7]."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to extend the table selection UI to support primary key designation, validation, user guidance, and persistence using Framer plugin data APIs.",
      "reasoning": "Requires extending UI logic, validating user input, and handling data persistence and change management. Ensuring the selected key meets database constraints adds moderate complexity[3][7]."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Field Mapping Interface",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the process for creating a UI that maps Supabase columns to Framer CMS fields, including type selection, smart defaults, validation, and configuration storage.",
      "reasoning": "Mapping disparate data models with type inference, user-driven configuration, and validation is non-trivial. The UI must be intuitive and robust, supporting various field types and error states[3][7]."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Transformation Logic",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of data transformation utilities that convert Supabase data to Framer CMS formats, handling all field types, validation, and edge cases.",
      "reasoning": "Data transformation must account for type mismatches, special cases, and data integrity. Supporting all required field types and robust error handling increases complexity[2][4]."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Upsert Synchronization Logic",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to build a synchronization engine that fetches paginated Supabase data, compares with Framer CMS, performs upserts, tracks progress, and handles errors and deletions.",
      "reasoning": "This is the core logic, involving data fetching, comparison, upsert operations, batching, and error handling. Ensuring performance and correctness with large datasets is challenging[2][8]."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and User Feedback",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Describe the steps to implement comprehensive error handling, user notifications, logging, and recovery mechanisms across all plugin operations.",
      "reasoning": "Requires designing a consistent error handling and notification system that integrates with the UI and supports troubleshooting and recovery, which is essential for user experience and maintainability[4][8]."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the final steps to complete both plugin modes, ensure integration with Framer, implement configuration persistence, add metadata, and optimize for performance and storage limits.",
      "reasoning": "Final integration and optimization require attention to detail but are less complex than core logic tasks. Ensuring compliance with Framer's plugin requirements and storage constraints is key[9]."
